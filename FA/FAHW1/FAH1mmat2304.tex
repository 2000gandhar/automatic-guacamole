\section{} %Problem 1 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item This statement is true. Take any vector space $V,$ which necessarily has a Hamel basis, trivially the entire space is a basis. Then for a choice 
	of basis $(b_n)$ we have for all $x \in V,$ $x=\sum k_ib_i,$ where the sum is finite. Then define $||x||:= \max \{|k_i|\}.$ See that this fulfills the 
	definition of a norm. 
	\item This statement is false. For sake of contradiction, let $(X,||\cdot||)$ be a normed linear space such that the induced metric is the discrete 
	metric. Then for $x,y \in X, x \neq y$ we must have $||x-y|| =1.$ Note that $2x\neq 2y,$ so we must have $||2x-2y||=2||x-y||=2,$ but by the discrete 
	metric the answer should still be $1!$ Thus there can be no such norm.
\end{enumerate}
\section{} %Problem 2 
We wish to show that the function $||\cdot|| $ on $X$ satisfies the triangle inequality iff the closed unit ball is convex.
Assume that the function $||\cdot||$ is indeed a norm. Then let $x,y \in D,$ the closed unit ball. Then $||x||,||y|| \leq 1.$ Now we have for $\alpha \in 
[0,1]$ $z=\alpha x+(1-\alpha)y.$ See that $$||z|| =||\alpha x+(1-\alpha)y|| \leq \alpha ||x|| + (1-\alpha) ||y|| \leq \alpha \cdot 1 + (1-\alpha) \cdot 1 
\leq 1,$$ thus we have $z \in D.$

Take two elements $x,y \in X$ both non-zero, since if either were zero the inequality would be trivial. Then $$||x+y|| = (||x||+||y||)\cdot 
\left|\left|\alpha \frac{x}{||x||}+ (1-\alpha)\frac{y}{||y||}\right|\right|,$$ where $\alpha=\frac{||x||}{||x||+||y||}.$ Note that 
$\frac{x}{||x||}=\frac{y}{||y||}=1,$ thus we can use the convexity condition to see that $\frac{||x+y||}{||x||+||y||} \leq 1,$ which is the triangle 
inequality.
\section{} %Problem 3 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pick a $f \in C([a,b]).$ Then $|f|\leq M=\sup\{|f(x)|:x \in [a,b]\}.$ Now see that $$\int_a^b|f(t)|^pdt \leq (b-a)M^p \geq 0.$$ Thus $||f||_p \geq 
	0.$
	For $f=0,$ we have $M=0,$ so $\int_a^b|0|^pdt=0.$ If $\int_a^b|f(t)|^pdt =0,$ then see that $0 \leq (b-a)M^p \geq 0.$ Thus we must have $$(b-a)M^p=0 
	\implies M=0 \implies f=0.$$ To see the next axiom, for $\alpha \in \mathbb{K},$ we have $\int_a^b|\alpha f(t)|^pdt =\int_a^b|\alpha|^p|f(t)|^pdt.$
	Then $$||\alpha f||_p= \left(|\alpha|^p\int_a^b|f(t)|^pdt\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} =|\alpha| ||f||_p.$$
	Now let $f,g \in C[a,b].$ Then we have to prove Minkowski's inequality to show the triangle inequality. 
	\begin{align*}
		||f+g||^p_p &= \int_{a}^b |f+g|^p dx\\
		&= \int_{a}^b |f+g|\cdot|f+g|^{p-1} dx\\
		&\leq \int_{a}^b |f||f+g|^{p-1} dx + \int_{a}^b |g||f+g|^{p-1} dx\\
		&\leq \left(\int_{a}^b |f|^{p} dx+\int_{a}^b |g|^{p} dx\right)\left(\int_{a}^b |f+g|^{(p-1)\frac{p}{p-1}} dx \right)^{1-\frac{1}{p}} 
		(\text{H\"{o}lder's inequality})\\
		&= (||f||_p+||g||_p)\frac{||f+g||_p^p}{||f+g||_p},
	\end{align*}
	which yields the required result.
	\item We consider $(f_n),$ which is a Cauchy sequence of $L^p$ functions. Take a subsequence of functions $(f_{n_i})$ where 
	$||f_{n_{i}} -f_{n_{i+1}}||_p < 2^{-i}.$ Now define $g_n(x)= \sum_{i=1}^{n}|f_{n_{i}} -f_{n_{i+1}}|$ and $g(x)= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|f_{n_{i}} 
	-f_{n_{i+1}}|.$  Using the triangle triangle inequality, we have $||g_n||_p \leq 1.$ By Fatou's lemma, we have 
	$$\int_{a}^b \liminf_{n} g_n \leq \liminf_{n} \int_{a}^b g_n.$$ 
	We must have $g_n$ converges almost everywhere on $X.$ We let $f(x) = \liminf_{n} f_{n_i}(x)$ for almost $x \in X,$ where the function $0$ wherever the 
	pointwise limit does not exist. Then we claim that this is the limit. 
	For $\varepsilon>0,$ take $N$ such that $||f_m-f_n||_p< \varepsilon$. By Fatou's lemma, we have 
	$$ \int_{a}^b |f-f_n|^p \leq \liminf_{n} \int_{a}^b |f_{n_i}-f_n|^p \leq \varepsilon^p,$$ which means $f \in L^p$ and $(f_n) \to f.$
	

\end{enumerate}
\section{} %Problem 4 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $||f_1-F||_{\infty}$ is to be found, where $F$ is the subspace of constant functions. Unfolding the term, we get 
	$$||f_1-F||_{\infty}= \inf_{c \in \mathbb{R} }\{ \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |t-c|  \},$$ which for $c \in [-1,0] \cup [1,2] $ is $1,$ while in $(0,1)$ it 
	decreases to $\frac{1}{2}$ then goes back up to $1.$ Thus, we must have $||f_1-F||_{\infty}=\frac{1}{2}.$
	\item We want to now see the distance between $f_2=t^2$ and $G,$ the space of all polynomials with degree at most $1.$ Then for some polynomial $-ax-b 
	\in G,$ we want to see $\inf_{a,b \in \mathbb{R}}\sup_{t \in [0,1]}\{|t^2+ax+b|\}.$ See that we have $\sup_{t \in [0,1]} |t^2-t+1/8|=\frac{1}{8}.$ This 
	is an upper bound.  
	See that by varying $a,$ we translate it along the $x-$axis. We can vary $b$, which gives us translation in the $y-$axis. Note that to minimise the 
	maximum value of $|t^2+at+b|$ we must have the value of the polynomial at $t=0,t=1,t=\frac{-a}{2}$ be the same. Then we take the polynomial to be 
	symmetric about $t=\frac{1}{2}.$ For this, $a=-1.$ Now we have $|t^2-t+b|,$ which attains a critical value at $t=\frac{1}{2},$ that is $\left|b - 
	\frac{1}{4}\right|.$ Thus we have $|b| =\left|b-\frac{1}{4} \right|.$ A solution is $b=\frac{1}{8}.$ See that the this then must indeed be $||t^2-G||.$  
\end{enumerate}
\section{} %Problem 5 
Let $Y$ and $X/Y$ be Banach spaces. Then take $(x_n)$ to be a Cauchy sequence in $X.$ That is, for all $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ 
such that for $m,n \geq N$ we have $$||x_m-x_n||< \varepsilon.$$
Consider the canonical projection $p: X \twoheadrightarrow X/Y.$ Its kernel is $Y.$ The sequence $(x_n)$ sent to $X/Y$ is also Cauchy, as $||(x_m-x_n)+Y|| 
\leq ||x_m-x_n|| < \varepsilon.$ This must converge to some coset $K$ in $X/Y,$ since $X/Y$ is Banach. Now pick an element $y_n$ such that $||(x_m-x_n)+y_n 
||<\varepsilon.$ Then this sequence $(y_n)$ is Cauchy since $ ||y_m-y_n|| < ||(x_n-y_n)-(x_m-y_m) ||< \varepsilon.$ Then we have that $y_n \to y,$ where $y 
\in Y.$ Now we propose that there is an element in $X$ that is $K+y,$ where $K$ is of the form $x+Y.$ Then we say that $x \in x+Y + y$ is the limit of 
$(x_n).$ Note that $Y$ contains $-y,$ so the element in $x+Y$ that corresponds to $-y \in Y$ is our choice of $X.$ See that $x_n +Y \to x+Y, $ and $y_n \to 
y,$ by setting $-y$ instead of $Y$ and adding the two convergent sequences in $X$ we get our desired result.

Let $X$ and $X/Y$ be Banach spaces. Then take $(y_n),$ a Cauchy sequence in $Y.$ Thus for all $\varepsilon > 0,$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that 
for $m,n \geq N,$ we have $||y_m-y_n||< \varepsilon.$ As a Cauchy sequence in $X,$ this must converge to some element $y_0 \in X.$ We now need to show that 
$y_0 \in Y.$ But since $Y$ is closed and $y_0$ is a limit point, we must have $y_0 \in Y.$

Let $X$ and $Y$ be Banach spaces. Take $(x_n)$ as a sequence in $X$ such that $(x_n+Y)$ is Cauchy. Then pick $\varepsilon>0.$ Then there is a $N \in 
\mathbb{N}$ such that for $m,n \geq N$ $||(x_m-x_n)+Y|| < \varepsilon.$ See that $||x_m-x_n|| \leq ||(x_m-x_n)+y||+||y||.$ Since the expression on the left 
is independent of $y,$ then we can set $||(x_m-x_n)+y||$ to $||(x_m-x_n)+Y||,$ and $||y||$ to $0,$ as $0 \in Y.$ Then we have $||x_m-x_n|| < \varepsilon,$ 
which means that $(x_n)$ is Cauchy. Then since $X$ is Banach, we have $x_n \to x.$ Then we propose that $x + Y$ is the limit of $(x_n+Y).$ See that 
$||(x_n+Y)-(x+Y)|| = || (x_n-x)+Y || = \inf_{y \in Y} \{||(x_n-x)+y|| \}.$ Then, for any choice of $y \in Y,$ we have $$ || (x_n-x)+Y || \leq || (x_n-x)+y 
||.$$ Then for $y=0,$ we have $$|| (x_n-x)+Y || \leq ||x_n-x|| < \varepsilon,$$ which implies that $X/Y$ is Banach. 



\section{} %Problem 6 
Assume that $X$ is a Banach space. Let $(x_n)$ be an absolutely convergent series in $X,$ that is, $\sum_{i=1}^n||x_i||$ converges to $c \in \mathbb{R}$ as 
$n \to \infty.$ Thus  $s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i,$ so for any $\varepsilon>0 $ there is some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for $n \geq N,$ we have 
$\sum_{i=N}^{\infty}||x_i|| < \varepsilon.$
Now we have $||s_n-s_m|| \leq \sum_{i=n+1}^{m} ||x_i|| < \varepsilon.$ Since $(s_n)$ is Cauchy, it must converge to some value $s \in X.$ Thus this sequence 
converges.

For the converse, take a Cauchy sequence $(x_n).$  For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ pick $n_k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for $m,n \geq n_k,$ we have $ ||x_{m}-x_n ||< 
2^{-k}.$ In particular, $||x_{n_{k+1}}-x_{n_k}||< 2^{-k}.$ Let $y_1=x_{n_1},$ and $y_n= x_{n_{k+1}}-x_{n_{k}}.$ From this, it follows that $\sum ||y_n|| 
\leq ||x_{n_1}||+1,$ thus this sequence is absolutely convergent. From this, see that this series must converge. Thus $ \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}y_n= \lim_{n \to 
\infty} x_n$ is defined, hence the space $X$ is Banach. 
\section{} %Problem 7 
Let $\ell^p$ be the space of all $p-$power summable sequences. Then $||(x_n)|| =(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|x_i|^p)^\frac{1}{p}.$ Now we want to show that the 
space 
$K=\{(x_n) \in \ell^p: x_i=0 \forall i>n, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is dense in $\ell^p.$ Take any $(x_n)^{(0)}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \ell^p.$ There is a 
sequence of elements in $\ell^p$ $(x_n)^{(m)} \subseteq K$ such that $x_n^{(m)}=x_n$ if $n \leq m,$ and $0$ otherwise. See that 
$||(x_n)^{(m)}-(x_n)^{(0)}||_p=\left(\sum_{i=m+1}^{\infty}|x_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}.$ Since $||(x_n)^{(m)}||_p \to ||(x_n)^{(0)}||_p$ as $m \to \infty,$ 
we must have for a choice of $\varepsilon >0$ there being $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for $m \geq N,$ $|||(x_n)^{(m)}||_p - ||(x_n)^{(0)}||_p|< 
\varepsilon. $ Multiplying on both sides by $\frac{||(x_n)^{(m)}||^p_p - ||(x_n)^{(0)}||^p_p}{||(x_n)^{(m)}||_p - ||(x_n)^{(0)}||_p},$ and after a change in 
the value of $\varepsilon,$ we get $$||(x_n)^{(m)}||^p_p - ||(x_n)^{(0)}||^p_p< \varepsilon.$$ Thus we have shown that $K$ is dense in $\ell^p.$ For a fixed 
$m,$ and a fixed $n,$ look at $x_n^{(m)}.$ This is a real number or a complex number, which can be approximated by a sequence of rationals (or elements of 
$\mathbb{Q}(i)$) such that $x_n^{(m)}$ is its limit. Now we have a sequence $(t_k),$ where $t_k \to x_n^{(m)}$ as $k \to \infty.$ 

Now let us see that $K'=\{(x_n) \in K: x_n \in \mathbb{Q} \text{ or} \mathbb{Q}(i)\} \subset K$ is countable, and as we saw above must be dense in $\ell^p.$ 
Thus it is separable.  
\section{} %Problem 8
We first show that $\ell^{\infty}$ is not separable. Take the space $K$ of all sequences in $\ell^{\infty}$ such that their entries are either $0$ or $1.$ 
Then for $x \neq y \in K,$ we have $||x_y||_{\infty} = 1,$ since at least one entry is different between the two. Then we have uncountably points. consider 
a ball of radius $\frac{1}{2}$ centred at $x \in K,$ for all such points in $K.$ We know what uncountably many open sets, all of which are disjoint from 
each other. Let $S$ be a possibly dense set. Then we have that each open ball contains at least one point of $S.$ This then means that there must be 
uncountably many elements, so $\ell^{\infty}.$ 

If there was a Schauder basis for $\ell^{\infty},$ then for all $x \in \ell^{\infty}$  we would have a sequence $(a_1,a_2,\dots)$ described using the basis. 
We can approximate each term by a sequence of elements in $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, which would then mean that we would have all the rational points 
of $\ell^{\infty}$ as a dense subset, which contradicts the fact that the space is not separable. Thus there can be no Schauder basis. 
\section{} %Problem 9
We want to see if this function is continuous. Pick a $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}.$ Now for all $\varepsilon > 0$ have $f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)=f(h).$ 

See that $f(2)=2f(1),$ $f(0)=2f(0) \implies f(0)=0,$  and that $f(0)=0=f(1)+f(-1) \implies f(-1)=-f(1).$ Thus $f(n)=nf(1)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}.$ We 
know that $f(1)=f\left(n \frac{1}{n}\right) \implies f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{n}f(1).$ Thus we have $f(q)=qf(1)$ for all $q \in \mathbb{Q}.$ Since 
any real number can be approximated by a sequence of rationals, we can easily see that for $q_n \to r$ and $n \to \infty,$ we have $f(q_n)=q_nf(1) \to 
rf(1).$ Thus we can extend this to all real numbers. Now we have $|f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)|=|hf(1)| < \varepsilon,$ for a choice of $h= \frac{\varepsilon}{|f(1)|}.$
\section{} %Problem 10 
Let $P([0,1])$ be the space of all real polynomials defined on $[0,1]$ be a real vector space. Let the norm of a polynomial $f(x)=a_0+a_1x+\dots+a_nx^n \in 
P([0,1])$ be given thus: $||f|| = |a_0|+|a_1|+\dots+|a_n|.$ Now see that the operator $I:P([0,1]) \rightarrow P([0,1])$ such that $x^t \mapsto 
\frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1},$ we then see that $$||I|| = \sup_{0 \neq x \in P([0,1])} \frac{||If||}{||f||} = \frac{a_0x+\dots 
\frac{a_n}{n+1}a_{n+1}}{a_0+\dots+a_nx^n }=\frac{|a_0|+\left|\frac{a_1}{2}\right|+\dots + \left|\frac{a_n}{n+1}\right|}{|a_0|+\dots+ |a_n|} \leq 1.$$ Also 
see that this supremum is indeed attained since $I(a_0)=a_0x,$ and in this case $\frac{||I(a_0)||}{||a_0||}=1.$ Thus we have $||I|| =1.$ We wish to find the 
inverse of this operator, see that the differential operator $D$ such that $x^t \mapsto tx^{t-1},$ is the required inverse. However, see that for 
$f(x)=x^n,$ we have $Df=I^{-1}f=nx^{n-1}.$ Now we have $$||D|| = \sup_{0 \neq x \in P([0,1])} \frac{||Df||}{||f||} \geq 
\frac{||Dx^n||}{||x^n||}=\frac{n}{1}.$$ Thus we have that our operator $D$ is unbounded, since for any chosen $N \in \mathbb{N}$ we can choose $x^{N+1},$ 
such that $ \frac{||Dx^{N+1}||}{||x^{N+1}||}$ is larger. 
\section{} %Problem 11
Since the linear functional $f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is unbounded, we have a sequence $(x_n)$ such that $f(x_n) > n ||x_n||.$ We can say without loss of 
generality, and by discarding non-zero elements, we have a sequence $(x_n)$ of norm $1.$ Pick $x \in X.$ Then see that the sequence 
$z_n=x-\frac{f(x)}{f(x_n)}x_n,$ which is clearly in $K,$ the kernel of $f.$ Also it can be seen that as $n \to \infty,$ we have $||z_n|| \leq$
\section{} %Problem 12 
Let $X$ be the subspace of all functions in $C[0,1]$ such that $f(0)=0.$ Let $Y$ be the closed subspace of functions in $X$ such that $\int_{0}^{1}f(t)dt = 
0.$ Then take any function $f \in X$ such that $||f|| =1.$ Consider the map $F: X \to \mathbb{R}$ where $$F(f)= \int_{0}^1 f(t)dt. $$
Then $Y= \ker F,$ and we have $ ||F|| = \sup_{||f|| =1} F(f) \leq 1 \cdot ||f||=1.$ Thus $||F|| =1.$
Now see that for $f \notin Y$ we have $ X=Y \oplus \text{span}\{f\}.$ Thus for $g \in X$ we have $g=f-ty,$ where $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $y \in Y.$ 
Thus $||F|| = \sup_{y \in Y, t \in \mathbb{R}}\frac{|F(f-ty)|}{||f-ty||}.$ 
Since $F(y)=0$ we have $$ ||F|| = \sup_{y \in Y, t \in \mathbb{R}}\frac{|F(f)|}{||f-ty||}=\sup_{g \in Y}\frac{|F(f)|}{||f-g||}=\frac{|F(x)|}{d(f,Y)}.$$
Thus we have for $||F||=1,$ $$d(f,Y)= |F(f)|.$$
Note that $x=1$ and $x=-1$ are the functions for which $|F(f)|=1,$ but these functions are not in $X.$ Thus we must have $d(f,Y)<1,$ which means Riesz's 
lemma cannot hold for $r=1 $ here.
