\section{} %Problem 1 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a conjugacy class, let $x \in G$ be a representative. Then $\mathcal{K}=\{gxg^{-1}: x \in G  \},$ and $$\sigma(\mathcal{K})= 
	\{ \sigma(gxg^{-1})= \sigma(g) \sigma(x) \sigma(g)^{-1}: g \in G\}.$$ Since $\sigma$ is an automorphism, it is a bijection. Then $\sigma(g)$ spans all 
	of $G.$ Then we have $\sigma(\mathcal{K})=\sigma(\text{Cl}(x))= \text{Cl}(\sigma(x)).$ Thus this is also a conjugacy class.
	\item See that in $S_n$ $\mathcal{K}=\text{Cl}((12)),$ that is, all elements that switch two and only two elements. 
	However, in general, the product of multiple transpositions also has order $2,$ but they are not transpositions. For example, in $S_n,$ where $n \geq 
	4,$ $(1 2)(3 4)$ has order $2,$ but are not $2-$cycles. For $n=2,$ there are no order $2$ permutations that aren't $2-$cycles, so this is vacuously true 
	for $n=2.$ For $n=3,$ the same principle applies since it is not possible to find two disjoint $2-$cycles. We have $ |\mathcal{K}| = \binom{n}{2},$ 
	while $|\mathcal{K'}| = \binom{n}{2}\binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n}{2} \dots \binom{n- 2 \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}{2},$ which is greater than 
	$|\mathcal{K}|$ for $n \geq 2.$ Thus $|\mathcal{K}| \neq |\mathcal{K'}|.$ 
	\item  
\end{enumerate}
\section{} %Problem 2 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $H$ be a non-abelian simple group. Consider $DH \trianglelefteq H.$ Then since $H$ is simple, we must have $DH= H$ or $DH=0.$ If $DH=0,$ then 
	$H$ would be abelian, which is not possible, thus $H$ is perfect.
	\item We know that $DH=H, DK=K.$ Thus any term in $H$ and $K$ can be seen as an element of the type $h_1h_2h_1^{-1}h_2^{-1}$ for $H$ and respectively 
	for $K.$ Thus we consider any word in $\langle H,K \rangle.$ Then it is of the form $h_1k_1 \dots h_n k_n,$ where $h_1,\dots, h_n \in H, k_1,\dots, k_n 
	\in K.$ We know that we can write any $h \in H$ and $k \in K$ can be written as an element of the commutator. The commutator is generated by such 
	elements. Thus we have $\langle H,K \rangle= D\langle H,K \rangle.$ 
	
	\item We propose that $D(g^{-1}Hg)=g^{-1}DHg.$ Take any element of $D(g^{-1}Hg),$ which is of the form 
	$(g^{-1}h_1g)(g^{-1}h_2g)(g^{-1}h_1^{-1}g)(g^{-1}h_2^{-1}g)=g^{-1}(h_1h_2h_1^{-1}h_2^{-1})g \in g^{-1}DHg.$ These operations are all if and only if 
	statements, hence $D(g^{-1}Hg)=g^{-1}DHg.$ If $H=DH,$ $D(g^{-1}Hg)=g^{-1}Hg.$
	\item If $G$ is simple, then either $DG=0$ or $DG=G.$ Then for abelian simple groups the maximal perfect subgroup is $0,$ and in the non-abelian case it 
	is $G$ itself. Both are clearly normal in $G.$ 
\end{enumerate}
\section{} %Problem 3 
Since $K$ is cyclic, it is generated by some element, say $x \in K,$ and we know that the map $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ are decided entirely by where it 
sends the element $x.$ We know that there exists $\sigma \in \text{Aut}(H)$ such that $\sigma \varphi_1(K) \sigma^{-1}= \varphi_2(K),$ so we have
$\sigma \varphi_1(x) \sigma^{-1} = \varphi_2(x)^l,$ for some $l \in \mathbb{Z}.$ Then $k=x^t \in K,$ we have $\sigma \varphi_1(k) \sigma^{-1}=(\sigma 
\varphi_1(x) \sigma^{-1})^t= \varphi_2(x)^{a},$ where $t \in \mathbb{Z}.$  

Take the map $\psi: H \rtimes_{\varphi_1} K \to H \rtimes_{\varphi_2} K$ where $\psi(h,k)=(\sigma(h),k^a).$ To see that this is a homomorphism, we have 

\begin{align*}
	\psi((h_1,k_1)\circ_{1}(h_2,k_2)) &= \psi((h_1 \varphi_1(k_1)(h_2),k_1k_2))\\
	&= (\sigma(h_1)\sigma(\varphi_1(k_1)(h_2)), (k_1k_2)^a).
\end{align*}
Also, see that \begin{align*}
	\psi((h_1,k_1))\circ_{2}\psi((h_2,k_2)) &= (\sigma(h_1),k_1^a) \circ_{2} (\sigma(h_2),k_2^a)\\
	&=(\sigma(h_1) \varphi_2(k_1)^a(\sigma(h_2)), (k_1k_2)^a)\\
	&=(\sigma(h_1)\sigma\varphi_1(k_1)\sigma^{-1}\sigma(h_2), (k_1k_2)^a)\\
	&= (\sigma(h_1)\sigma(\varphi_1(k_1)(h_2)), (k_1k_2)^a). 
\end{align*}

This shows that we have a homomorphism. Define $\theta:H \rtimes_{\varphi_2} K \to H \rtimes_{\varphi_1} K,$ such that 
$\theta(h,k)=(\sigma^{-1}(h),k^{a'}),$ for some $a' \in \mathbb{Z}.$ If $K$ is finite then there exists some $ $
\section{} %Problem 4 
We have $|G| =75.$ We clearly have a $5-$Sylow subgroup of order $25,$ as well as a $3-$Sylow group of order $3.$ Since the number of $5-$Sylow subgroups 
must be $5k+1$ and $5k+1|3,$ we are forced to have a normal subgroup of order $25.$ Then let $H \trianglelefteq G$ where $|H|=25.$ Let $K$ be some $3-$Sylow 
subgroup of order $3.$ Then by Lagrange's theorem, $|H \cap K|=1,$ so we can construct a semi-direct product of the groups.  
\section{} %Problem 5
Let $n= p_1^{\alpha_1}\dots p_r^{\alpha_r}$ be such that $\alpha_i=1,2$ for all $1 \leq i \leq r$ and $p_i \nmid p_j^{\alpha_j}-1$ for all $i,j.$ 
Assume WLOG that $p_1 < \dots < p_r.$ Then we have that the number of $p_r-$Sylow subgroups is of the form $p_rk+1,$ and since $p_rk+1 | p_1^{\alpha_1}\dots 
p_{r-1}^{\alpha_{r-1}},$ we have $p_rk+1|p_i^{\alpha_i},$ for $1 \leq i \leq r-1.$ Since $p_r$ is the largest prime, we 

The converse can be shown by proving the contrapositive. See that if we have $n=p_1^{\alpha_1}\dots p_r^{\alpha_r},$ and $\alpha_i>2$ for some $i,$ or $p_i 
| p_j^{\alpha_j}-1$ for some $i,j,$ then we are done. To check the first case, take $D_8,$ which has order $8=2^3.$ This group has centre $\{1,r^2\},$ which 
implies that this group is not abelian.

Now for the other case, take the group of order $75$ as we showed in the previous question was non-abelian. In that case, we had $3|25-1.$ Thus we have that 
a  $n$
