\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $R$ be a UFD. Suppose $I \subseteq R[x]$ is an ideal containing two nonzero elements $f,g$ having no common factor. Prove that $I$ contains a nonzero constant, i.e., and element of $R\backslash \{0\}\}.$
	\item Let $R$ be a PID and $f,g \in R[x]$ be $2$ nonzero polyomials having no common factor. Prove that there are only finitely many prime ideals in $R[x]$ containing $f$ and $g$. Moreover, any such prime ideal is maximal and is of the type $(p,h(x)),$ where $p$ is a nonzero prime element of $R$ and $\overline{h(x)} \in \frac{R}{pR}[x]$ is irreducible.
	
	\item Let $R$ be a PID. Prove that any prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$  in $R[x]$ is in one of the two following forms: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\mathfrak{p}=(0),$
		\item $\mathfrak{p}=(f(x)),$ for some irreducible polynomial $f,$
		\item $\mathfrak{p}=(p,h(x)),$ where $p \in R\backslash \{0\}$ is a nonzero prime element of $R$ and $R$ and $\overline{h(x)}$ is irreducible modulo $p.$
	\end{enumerate}
	Moreover the primes in $(iii)$ are maximal.
